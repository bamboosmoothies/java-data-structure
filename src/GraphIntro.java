     * Graph = non linear aggregations of nodes and edges
     * node = known as a vertex contains may contain some piece of data
     * edge = a connection between two nodes
     * 
     * undirected graph EX social networks
     * if two nodes are connected, they have what is known as adjacency; sharing a
     * border, wall, point
     * 
     * directed graph EX street map
     * contains edges that will linked one node to another; one way connection
     * 
     * popular way to traverse:
     * adjacency matrix
     * adjacency list
